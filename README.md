# Youtube-Search-LLM
This is a FastAPI system. 
It is a chatbot and is powered by Gemini Pro and Gemini Pro Vision. The user needs to enter topics and the chatbot would convert the user's topic to a search query and use the Youtube Search API to search for YouTube videos and then provides links of those videos. 

It can also provide links to YouTube videos based on the contents of an image. However, the image upload doesn't support multi-turn chats.
