# Youtube-Search-LLM
This is a FastAPI system. 
It is a chatbot powered by Gemini Pro and Gemini Pro Vision. The user needs to enter topics and the chatbot converts the user's topic to a search query and uses the Youtube Search API to search for YouTube videos and then provides links to those videos along with an explanation of the solution to those problems. 

It can also provide links to YouTube videos based on the contents of an image. However, the image upload doesn't support multi-turn chats.

The primary use case was targeted at getting YouTube video solutions to mathematics problems but the chatbot can generally handle any kind of queries.

API endpoints can integrate a simple streamlit UI on the front end.
