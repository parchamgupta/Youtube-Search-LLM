          "Explanation:\nThe second identity you mentioned is the associative property of multiplication. This property states that when multiplying three or more numbers, the grouping of the factors does not affect the product. In other words, (ab)c = a(bc).\n\nFor example, let's consider the expression (2 * 3) * 4. According to the associative property, we can group the factors as (2 * 3) * 4 or 2 * (3 * 4). Evaluating both expressions, we get:\n\n(2 * 3) * 4 = 6 * 4 = 24\n2 * (3 * 4) = 2 * 12 = 24\n\nAs you can see, the product is the same regardless of how we group the factors.\n\nThe associative property is important because it allows us to simplify and evaluate expressions more easily. For example, we can use the associative property to rewrite the expression (a + b) * c as a * c + b * c. This makes it easier to evaluate the expression, especially when a, b, and c are large numbers or complex expressions.\n\nYoutube Search String:\nAssociative property of multiplication explained"
